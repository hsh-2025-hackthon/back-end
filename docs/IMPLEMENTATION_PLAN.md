*   **Risk Assessment & Mitigation:** Addressing external API limitations (fallback/caching), real-time communication performance (Azure Web PubSub scaling), data synchronization conflicts (CRDTs), third-party service dependencies (circuit breakers, fallbacks), data privacy compliance, and cost control.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   **Functional Completeness:** 100% API endpoint implementation, 90% test coverage, all external integrations operational.
    *   **Performance:** API response time < 500ms, real-time message latency < 100ms, system availability > 99.9%.
