*   **AI/ML Pipeline:** Azure Cognitive Search (vector database), Azure OpenAI Service (LLM integration), Azure AI Agent Service (agent orchestration), structured prompt engineering.
    *   **Security:** OAuth 2.0 with Google OAuth, data encryption using Azure encryption services.
*   **Scalability:** Multi-layer caching with Azure Redis Cache, Azure CDN for static content, horizontal scaling with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
*   **DevOps:** CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, comprehensive monitoring with Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** >80% coverage for repository, service, utility functions, and validation logic.
    *   **Integration Tests:** >70% coverage for API endpoints, database operations, external service integrations, and WebSocket connections.
    *   **End-to-End Tests:** 100% coverage for major user flows, collaboration features, real-time communication, and error handling.
*   **Risk Assessment & Mitigation:** Addressing external API limitations (fallback/caching), real-time communication performance (Azure Web PubSub scaling), data synchronization conflicts (CRDTs), third-party service dependencies (circuit breakers, fallbacks), data privacy compliance, and cost control.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   **Functional Completeness:** 100% API endpoint implementation, 90% test coverage, all external integrations operational.
    *   **Performance:** API response time < 500ms, real-time message latency < 100ms, system availability > 99.9%.
    *   **User Experience:** Complete end-to-end workflows, intuitive quick actions, reliable notification system.
