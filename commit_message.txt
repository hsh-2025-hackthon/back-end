feat: Migrate to OpenAI API and refactor infrastructure

This commit introduces several significant changes:
- Migrated from Azure OpenAI to the standard OpenAI API, updating environment variables, API client configuration, and model usage (gpt-4o).
- Updated Docker Compose configuration for port mapping, Redis URL, and switched to pgvector/pgvector:pg15 for PostgreSQL.
- Simplified service health checks by removing Azure-specific dependencies (Cosmos DB, Event Hubs, Azure Search, Web PubSub).
- Refactored trip event processor to be manually started from server.ts, and added duplicate handler prevention for service bus.
- Added `getMessageById` to ChatRepository for improved chat message retrieval.
- Corrected a routing issue in `server.ts`.
- Added new API documentation.
