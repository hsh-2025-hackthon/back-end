## Backend Implementation

The backend is a modular monolith built with Node.js and TypeScript. It follows a CQRS pattern for complex operations.

-   **Commands:** Write operations are handled as commands that update the primary PostgreSQL database and emit events.
-   **Queries:** Read operations fetch data from the denormalized, read-optimized Azure Cosmos DB.

Microservices are used for:
-   **AI Recommendation Engine:** A Python service in an Azure Container App.
-   **Real-time Collaboration Service:** An Azure Function or a small Node.js service to manage Web PubSub connections.
-   **File Processing:** Azure Functions triggered by Azure Blob Storage events.

## API Design

The API is designed using a modular approach, with a focus on security and scalability.

-   **API Gateway:** Azure API Management is used as the API gateway, providing a unified entry point for all clients. It enforces policies for:
    -   Authentication and authorization
    -   Rate limiting
    -   CORS
-   **Authentication:** JWTs issued by Azure AD B2C are used to authenticate API requests.
-   **WebSockets:** Real-time communication is handled through Azure Web PubSub, with a dedicated service for managing connections and broadcasting messages.

## Database Design

The database architecture is designed for both transactional integrity and read scalability.

-   **Azure Database for PostgreSQL:** The primary database for all transactional data, ensuring ACID compliance. It is used for user accounts, bookings, and other critical data. Row-Level Security (RLS) is implemented to enforce data isolation.
-   **Azure Cosmos DB:** Used for read-optimized models. Data from PostgreSQL is denormalized and synced to Cosmos DB to provide low-latency read access for features like trip itineraries.
-   **Versioning:** The Azure Cosmos DB Change Feed is used to implement a versioning system for documents, enabling features like audit trails and collaborative history.

## Real-Time Collaboration

Real-time collaboration is a core feature of the system, enabling multiple users to plan trips together simultaneously.

-   **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs):** The frontend uses Yjs, a CRDT implementation, to handle concurrent edits without conflicts.
-   **Signaling Server:** Azure Web PubSub acts as the signaling server, broadcasting changes to all connected clients in a trip planning session.
-   **State Management:** Jotai is used for atomic state management on the frontend, ensuring efficient and conflict-free updates.

## AI/ML Pipeline

The AI/ML pipeline provides intelligent features for travel planning.

-   **Vector Database:** Azure Cognitive Search is used as a vector database, with capabilities for semantic and hybrid search.
-   **LLM Integration:** Azure OpenAI Service provides access to large language models like GPT-4 for generating itineraries, offering recommendations, and more.
-   **Agent Orchestration:** The system is designed to use the Azure AI Agent Service for orchestrating multi-agent scenarios, such as a "planner agent" and a "budget agent" collaborating to create the perfect trip.
-   **Prompt Engineering:** Structured prompts are used to ensure consistent and high-quality outputs from the language models.

## Security

Security is a top priority, with a multi-layered approach to protect user data.

-   **Authentication:** Azure AD B2C provides a comprehensive identity management solution with support for multi-factor authentication and social identity providers.
-   **API Key Management:** Azure Key Vault is used to securely store and manage all API keys, secrets, and connection strings. Managed identities are used to access the vault, eliminating the need for hardcoded credentials.
-   **Data Encryption:**
    -   **At Rest:** Azure Storage Service Encryption is used to automatically encrypt all data.
    -   **In Transit:** Azure Application Gateway with SSL/TLS termination secures all data in transit.

## Scalability

The system is designed to scale horizontally to handle a growing number of users and increasing load.

-   **Caching:** A multi-layer caching strategy is implemented using Azure Cache for Redis for data caching and Azure CDN for static content delivery.
-   **Horizontal Scaling:** The backend is designed to be deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), with autoscaling configured based on metrics from Azure Monitor. This allows the system to automatically adjust the number of running instances to meet demand.

## DevOps

A robust DevOps process is in place to ensure continuous integration, delivery, and monitoring.

-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Azure DevOps is used to create a full CI/CD pipeline, including automated builds, testing, security scanning, and deployment.
-   **Monitoring:** Azure Monitor and Application Insights provide comprehensive monitoring of the entire system, with custom dashboards and alerts for key metrics.

## Third-Party Integrations

The system integrates with third-party services to provide a rich user experience.

-   **Google Maps:** The Google Maps JavaScript API is used for mapping and location-based services, with Azure-specific resilience patterns to handle potential failures.
-   **Multi-Provider API Resilience:** For services like flight and hotel searches, the system is designed to work with multiple providers, with built-in failover and health-checking mechanisms.
